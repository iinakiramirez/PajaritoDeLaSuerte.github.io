      <h2>A Sound Design and Divination Instrument</h2>
    
      <div class="box1">
        <p id="quote">“I dream of instruments obedient to my thought and which with their contribution of a whole new world of unsuspected sounds, will lend themselves to the exigencies of my inner rhythm.” - Edgar Varèse (The Liberation of Sound) </p>
        <p id="m-text"> Pajarito De La Suerte is a Max for Live Device that allows you to immediately create interesting sounds at a click of a button. This device was design as a solution for creative blockages and indecision, functioning as a divination tool that leads you into fresh sonic landscapes. As of its sonic flexibility and experimental nature, Pajarito De La Suerte can produce a wide spectrum of sounds, from percussion and short decay sounds, to drones and complex musique concrete manipulations. These sounds can be used for a wide variety of practices, such as compositional elements in a track, sound design for any visual media, and as sound objects for electroacoustic compositions and performance. <br> <br>
          The device is composed of three main building blocks: First a granular synthesis engine, were samples are loaded and transformed through this  synthesis technique. Second, a generative multi-clock sequencer, that produces interesting rhythms and modulation. Third, a complex stochastic algorithm and decision tree, that changes the parameters of both the sequencer and the grain engine. </p>
