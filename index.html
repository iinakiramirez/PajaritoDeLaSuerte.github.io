        <h2>
          A Generative Sound Stream System</h2>
        <p id="quote">“I dream of instruments obedient to my thought and which with their contribution of a whole new world of unsuspected sounds, will lend themselves to the exigencies of my inner rhythm.”  </p>
        <p>“There will no longer be the old conception of melody or interplay of melodies. The entire work will be a melodic totality. The entire work will flow as a river flows.”</p>
        <p>- <strong class="bbold">Edgar Varèse (The Liberation of Sound)</strong></p>
        <p id="m-text"> Pajarito De La Suerte is a Max for Live Device that allows you to immediately create interesting sounds at a click of a button. This device was design as a solution for creative blockages and indecision, functioning as a divination tool that leads you into fresh sonic landscapes. As of its sonic flexibility and experimental nature, Pajarito De La Suerte can produce a wide spectrum of sounds, from percussion and short decay sounds, to drones and complex musique concrete manipulations. These sounds can be used for a wide variety of practices, such as compositional elements in a track, sound design for any visual media, and as sound objects for electroacoustic compositions and performance. <br> <br>
          As implied by the title, the device draws inspiration from the Mexican divination practice known as Pajaritos De La Suerte. This tradition revolves around a bird master and his cage housing trained birds. The bird master opens the cage and places a small basket filled with tiny papers near the opening. The bird then emerges and selects one of these papers, each bearing a fortune or prediction. The M4L device serves as a symbolic embodiment of this tradition. When composers and users are dry in creative ideas or do not know what path to take, they will turn to the aid of Pajarito De La Suerte. By simply clicking the button of the device, the divination algorithm initiates, crafting an ideal sound tailored to the composer’s requirements. Through iterations of this process, fresh sonic perspectives emerge, initiating and urging the user’s creative journey. <br><br>
          The device is composed of three main building blocks: First a granular synthesis engine, were samples are loaded and transformed through this synthesis technique. Second, a generative multi-clock sequencer, that produces interesting rhythms and modulation. These rhythms are self-evolving and will change on its own through time. Third, a complex stochastic algorithm and decision tree, activated by the generate button of the device, changing the parameters of both the sequencer and grain engine. As well, through this algorithm different modes of modulation might be selected or deselected in the synthesis process of the device. <br> <br>
          For more information on the synthesis and DSP techniques used in the device, check the following sources.The granular synthesis in this device was mainly inspired by Curtis Roads and his book Microsound that can be found <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/d/d1/Roads_Curtis_Microsound.pdf " target="_blank">here.</a> The sequencer was inspired in the practice of Mark Fell and his algorithmic composition, more information <a href="https://www.factmag.com/2018/10/06/mark-fell-signal-path/ " target="_blank">here.</a> Finally the chance algorithm was inspired in Iannis Xenakis and stochastic composition, more information <a href="http://sites.music.columbia.edu/cmc/courses/g6611/spring2012/week12/Gendy3.pdf " target="_blank">here.</a>

        <h3>Interface:</h3>
        <p>Pajarito De La Suerte has only five parameters making it very easy to use. The sound generator in this device is a grain engine, which means that the device requires an input audio sample to function. Samples need to be dragged and dropped in the <strong class="bbold">Audio Buffer</strong>. <u> Please note that this device only works on WAV files.</u> The device will manipulate and recontextualise the samples used, so the selection of the input sample will drastically impact the sonic character of the output.</p>
        <p>Then the device has a slider labelled <strong class="bbold">Sequence/Drone</strong>, which shifts between the form of the amplitude envelope. If the slider is placed at its rightmost maximum or value 127, the amplitude enveloped is disabled, generating a drone. From there, moving the slider to the left will enable the envelope, triggered by the sequencer. The further left the slider goes, the shorter the decay in the envelope becomes. <u>Please note that the Ableton transport most be on for the sequencer to run.</u> </p>
        <p> The <strong class="bbold">Loop Toggle</strong> makes the sequencer loop in a specific pattern instead of being generative. </p>
        <p>The <strong class="bbold"> Generate Button </strong> is the most important parameter in the device. When pushed the algorithm will choose specific parameters or modulations in both the sequencer and the grain engine. Each single click of the button might result in drastic sonic changes, so if you like something ensure you record it as it can be lost for ever if the button gets clicked again. </p>
        <p>Finally you get the <strong class="bbold">Gain Meter</strong> at the end, to adjust output volume. </p>
        <h3>Getting Started:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose a WAV audio file and drag and drop it in the <strong class="bbold">Audio Buffer</strong>.</li>
          <li>Start <strong class="bbold">Ableton’s Transport</strong>. The sequencer and some modulation do not work without it. </li>
          <li>Position the slider labelled <strong class="bbold">Sequence/Drone</strong> to its rightmost position. This will generate a sustain sound or a drone. </li>
          <li>Click the  <strong class="bbold"> Generate Button </strong>to change the characteristic of the sound. </li>
          <li>Test the sequencer by moving the slider towards the left, experimenting with different decay lengths. If no sound is produced it is probable that the transport is off or that the playback head of the sample is in a position with no data. </li>
          <li>Keep clicking the <strong class="bbold"> Generate Button </strong> to change and manipulate the sound. </li>
          <li>If you find a sequence that you like, turn on the <strong class="bbold">Loop Toggle</strong>. This will freeze the sequence in a 16 bar beat. </li>
          <li>Finally adjust the <strong class="bbold">Gain Meter</strong> for desired levels. If the input sample has a high gain then the meter will probably clip. </li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Audio Examples:</h3>
          <p>The following recordings are exploratory experiments carried away with The Stream device, in order to explore its sonic aesthetic and capabilities. As the device is generative, the only interaction with the device was choosing which audio files where fed into it and how many devices would run at the same time. The structuring and composition of sonic elements were set by the flow of The Stream. </p>
          <h4>Atabaque Stream:</h4>
          <p>This composition was created using four The Stream devices, each employing the same sample a recording of atabaque drums performance. Within it, very interesting rhythms and progression can be heard throughout the  composition, flowing smoothly through each sonic element. </p>

          <h4>Five Streams:</h4>
          <p>The following composition consists of 5 The Stream devices running simultaneously, each with its unique sample. The samples were chosen randomly from a sound library. Even though the samples differ sonically from each other, The Stream manages to create interesting progressions from them. Introducing novel transformations of each sample throughout the composition.</p>

          <h4>I Am Sitting In A Stream:</h4>
          <p>This last experiment is an ode to Alvin Lucier iconic piece I Am Sitting In A Room. In the experiment, Lucier’s own recording serves as the initial input for The Stream device. Subsequently, the device transforms the recording and its output gets recorded and fed back into it. This process continues until the output bears little resemblance to its original form. Much like  Lucier’s piece, this experimented uncovered the inherent resonances of The Stream, extracting only abstract grains and revealing the algorithms at play. The experiment was conducted twice, creating the two parts of the composition. Despite following identical processes, each part is completely unique, showcasing the device capability of endless variation. </p>
